# Self-Guided Contrastive Learning for BERT Sentence Representations

This repository is dedicated for releasing the implementation of the models utilized in the paper named **Self-Guided Contrastive Learning for BERT Sentence Representations (ACL 21)**.

Unfortunately, I'm still on the way of polishing my code for making it public.

Please stay tuned for update!

Thank you.
